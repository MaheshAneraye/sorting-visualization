Sorting Visualization Project
This project is a web application that visualizes sorting algorithms using a graphical representation. The application is built with Node.js and utilizes the p5.js library for rendering.

Features
Visualizes sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.

Allows users to set a minimum and maximum range for the values.

Enables users to define the number of values to visualize.

Supports both ascending and descending sorting orders.

Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.

Express: Web framework for Node.js.

p5.js: Library for creative coding and visualizations.

Docker: Containerization platform for easy deployment.
